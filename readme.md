My MVC Framework

1. Introduction

My own php MVC framework that I decided to build to level up my OOP skills. 
Decided to write this documentation to make sure I understand what I'm doing.
I'm amending when I'm bored or don't have much to do. if you by any chance find this repo..

Thanks for readin in advance... haha jk.. I know programmers are lazy to read, they watch tutorials..
So this documentation is for me basically, so if something breaks how I know how to fix it.

I'm gonna make a video version of this documentation..The goal is to convert this basic framwork into 
something powerful like laravel. Once it gets to that level, I'll create a course on 'How to build a powerful 
 MVC php framework' and sell it on youdemy. Wish me luck if you read up till this point :)

URLS

In a php application that is not powered by a framework..all urls have a .php extenstion.
And you run your scripts by typing the script name in the url bar, e.g domain.co.za/add_user.php.

That is not how things work in an mvc application. The .php extenstion is removed from the urls.
And the urls is broken has two or 3 parts. e.g domain.co.za/user/add or domain.co.za/user/edit/1.

The firrst part of the url is a class, and the second part is a method from a class and the 3rd part is option 
request parameters.

All requests are routed to a relevant class and a method. All of that is handled by the Router class
