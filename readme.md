My MVC Framework

1. Introduction

       My own php MVC framework that I decided to build to level up my OOP skills. 
       Decided to write this documentation to make sure I understand what I'm doing.
       I'm amending when I'm bored or don't have much to do. if you by any chance find this repo..

       Thanks for readin in advance... haha jk.. I know programmers are lazy to read, they watch tutorials..
       I'm gonna make a video version of this documentation..The goal is to convert this basic framwork into 
       something powerful like laravel.

Installation
...coming soon.
